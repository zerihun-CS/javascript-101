Introduction on JavaScript  ACT-Students

Hello Devs,so what is javaScript ?

The most popular and extensively used client-side scripting language. Scripts that operate within your web browser are known as client-side scripting. JavaScript is a scripting language that manipulates the content returned from a web server to add interactivity and dynamic effects to online pages.

Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in many other areas such as server-side development, mobile app development and so on.

Because of its wide range of applications, you can run JavaScript in several ways:

    1 Using console tab of web browsers
    2 Using Node.js
    3 By creating web pages


JavaScript is an object-oriented language with syntax that resembles that of the Java programming language. JavaScript, on the other hand, has nothing to do with Java.

ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturers Association) is the official name for JavaScript. The current significant version of the ECMAScript standard is ECMAScript 6 (aka ES6).
