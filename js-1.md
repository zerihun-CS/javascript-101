JavaScript Syntax

The syntax of JavaScript is the set of rules that define a correctly structured JavaScript program.

A JavaScript consists of JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script></script> HTML tags in a web page, or within the external JavaScript file having .js extension.

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var sum = x + y;
document.write(sum); // Prints variable value

```


Case Sensitivity in JavaScript

JavaScript is case-sensitive. This means that variables, language keywords, function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

var myVar = "Hello World!";
console.log(myVar);
console.log(MyVar);
console.log(myvar);

JavaScript Comments

JavaScript comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. They are completely ignored by JavaScript engines.

There are two ways to add comments to code:

    // - Single Line Comments
    /* */ -Multi-line Comments

```js
name = "Chandler Bing";

// printing name on the console
console.log("Hello " + name);
```

Multi-line Comments

```js
/* The following program contains the source code for a game called Baghchal. 

Chandler: Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Im still Toby.
